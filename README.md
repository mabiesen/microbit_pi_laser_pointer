# microbit_pi_laser_pointer
Project using the microbit to send messages to raspberry pi, which will in turn move a laser pointer

Project will use two microbits and 1 raspberry pi

1 microbit will be connected directly to the raspberry pi and act in the capacity of a hub.  The other microbit will be powered by battery and will be used to control motion of the laser pointer using the onboard accelerometer and compass.

The raspberry pi in turn is connected to two servo motors(180 degree capability) which will control the x and y movements of the laser pointer
